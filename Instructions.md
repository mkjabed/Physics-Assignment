**Problem #1: The Wavelength Calculator**
Your program should print the wavelength of visible light in a double slit diffraction experiment.
The values of m, O, and d should be given as input. The output should be:
a. The numeric value of the wavelength
b. The color of the light

Please note the following:
• X should be in nm (10^-9)
• d and a's are in µm (10^-6 )

**Problem #2**
If a diffraction grating produces a third-order bright spot for green light (of wavelength 530 nm)
at 65.00 from the central maximum, at what angle will the second-order bright spot be for red
light (of wavelength 700 nm)?
