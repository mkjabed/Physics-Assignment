**Problem #1: The Wavelength Calculator**
Your program should print the wavelength of visible light in a double-slit diffraction experiment. <br>
The values of m, O, and d should be given as input. The output should be: <br>
a. The numeric value of the wavelength <br>
b. The color of the light <br>

<br>

Please note the following: <br>
• λ should be in nm (10^-9) <br>
• d and a's are in µm (10^-6 )  <br>

**Problem #2**  <br>
If a diffraction grating produces a third-order bright spot for green light (of wavelength 530 nm)
at 65.00 from the central maximum, at what angle will the second-order bright spot be for red
light (of wavelength 700 nm)?
